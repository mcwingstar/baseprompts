### Gaps & Development Areas

**Commercial Experience**
- No P&L ownership or budget authority in current role
- Limited exposure to revenue-generating products (aside from Allianz UX consulting)
- Minimal pricing, monetization, or commercial negotiation experience
- Never worked in for-profit tech or startup environment

**Finance & Business Acumen**
- No formal finance training beyond undergrad economics
- Limited understanding of M&A, capital allocation, or corporate growth mechanics
- Needs credibility in hard commercial metrics beyond user engagement

**Corporate Navigation**
- 8 years in one public sector organization creates perception risk
- Unknown ability to operate in high-velocity, commercially-driven environments
- May be perceived as lacking political savvy for corporate settings

## Career Transition Strategy

### MBA Focus (May 2026 - May 2027)

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Break the public sector typecast through clean exit and full-time immersion
2. Build finance and commercial credibility
3. Access corporate recruiting pipelines designed for career switchers
4. Create new proof points through Strategic Consulting Project

**Recommended Electives (6 courses):**

**Must Take:**
1. **Financial Strategy or M&A** - Build hard finance credibility, understand corporate growth mechanics
2. **Negotiation Skills** - Develop political/commercial negotiation muscle lacking from consensus-driven public sector
3. **Strategic Consulting Project** - Real corporate credential, client case study, network building
4. **Entrepreneurship from the Inside** - Bridge product background with intrapreneurship language

**Strong Considerations:**
5. **Advanced Finance** - Double down on commercial fundamentals
6. **Implementing Strategy** - Demonstrate execution capability in complex organizations

**Avoid:** Social Impact cluster (reinforces public sector typecasting), Change Management theory (too academic), Project Management (too tactical)

### Target Role Profile

**Ideal Next Role (Post-MBA):**
- Senior Product Manager / Director of Product at Series B-D startup or scale-up
- Product leadership role at mid-size tech company (200-2000 employees)
- General Management track in media/tech company using AI technologies
- Corporate innovation or digital transformation role (bridge between product and strategy)

**Company Characteristics:**
- Fast-paced, outcome-driven culture
- Leveraging AI technologies meaningfully
- Series B-D startup or small-to-medium established tech company
- Strong product culture, not legacy enterprise
- Preference for Sydney-based or remote-friendly

**Deal Breakers:**
- Large legacy corporations with slow decision-making
- Highly hierarchical, bureaucratic environments
- Organizations without commercial pressure or urgency
- Poor culture or toxic leadership

**Compensation Expectations:**
- Minimum: $180-200k base (increase from current $169k)
- Target: $220-280k total comp for senior product role
- Open to lower base for exceptional startup opportunity with meaningful equity

## Positioning Strategy

### Resume Narrative Arc

**Frame the Story:**
"Product leader who built and scaled consumer audio products to millions of users, now seeking to apply deep product craft and strategic thinking in fast-moving commercial environments."

**Key Proof Points to Emphasize:**
- 20% YOY growth sustained over 3 years (demonstrate impact at scale)
- Award-winning product redesign (external validation of craft)
- Cross-functional leadership breadth (tech → design → strategy → product)
- Team building and stakeholder management in complex matrix org
- Early AI/personalization work (2016-2018 algorithmic discovery)

**Address the Gaps:**
- Position MBA as deliberate investment in commercial acumen and finance literacy
- Highlight Allianz consulting as commercial experience (even if limited)
- Frame public sector as training ground for stakeholder complexity, now seeking faster pace
- Emphasize breadth of technical foundation (network engineer → developer → designer → product leader)

### Interview Talking Points

**Why Leave ABC?**
"I'm proud of building products that serve millions of Australians, but I'm seeking environments where decisions move faster and commercial pressure drives focused innovation. The MBA is my bridge to bring deep product craft into organizations that move at the pace I want to work."

**Why MBA Now?**
"After 8 years building product leadership skills, I recognized I needed formal training in finance and strategy to make the jump to general management. The full-time MBA gives me that foundation while creating a clean break to reposition myself for corporate roles."

**What Do You Bring?**
"I bring proven ability to scale products, build high-performing teams, and navigate complex stakeholder environments. My technical foundation means I can work effectively with engineering, my design background means I obsess over user experience, and my strategic training means I connect product decisions to business outcomes."

**Address the Public Sector Concern Head-On:**
"I understand the perception risk of 8 years in public media. That's precisely why I'm doing the MBA and being deliberate about this transition. I've consistently delivered growth in a complex, stakeholder-heavy environment. Now I want to apply that discipline in commercial settings where urgency and focus can compound impact faster."
