## Career Transition Strategy

### MBA Focus (May 2026 - May 2027)

**Primary Objectives:**
1. Break the public sector typecast through clean exit and full-time immersion
2. Build finance and commercial credibility
3. Access corporate recruiting pipelines designed for career switchers
4. Create new proof points through Strategic Consulting Project

**Recommended Electives (6 courses):**

**Must Take:**
1. **Financial Strategy or M&A** - Build hard finance credibility, understand corporate growth mechanics
2. **Negotiation Skills** - Develop political/commercial negotiation muscle lacking from consensus-driven public sector
3. **Strategic Consulting Project** - Real corporate credential, client case study, network building
4. **Entrepreneurship from the Inside** - Bridge product background with intrapreneurship language

**Strong Considerations:**
5. **Advanced Finance** - Double down on commercial fundamentals
6. **Implementing Strategy** - Demonstrate execution capability in complex organizations

**Avoid:** Social Impact cluster (reinforces public sector typecasting), Change Management theory (too academic), Project Management (too tactical)

### Target Role Profile

**Ideal Next Role (Post-MBA):**
Senior product leadership role optimized for impact and growth trajectory, not specific title. Open to Director of Product, Senior Group PM, VP Product, or Head of Product depending on actual scope and authority.

**Core Criteria (Impact-Based):**
- **Strategic Influence:** Direct input into product strategy, access to founders/C-suite, ability to shape roadmap
- **Team Leadership:** Leading 5-15+ people, building/coaching team, creating product culture
- **Decision Authority:** Days/weeks decision cycles, high autonomy, minimal approval layers
- **Commercial Exposure:** Visibility into unit economics, involved in pricing/packaging, connect product to revenue
- **Growth Path:** Clear trajectory to VP Product or GM within 2-3 years as company scales

**Company Characteristics:**
- Series B-C (50-500 employees) where scope can expand as company grows
- Fast-paced, outcome-driven culture with minimal bureaucracy
- AI-forward mindset (agile in adopting AI, not necessarily AI company)
- Strong product culture (product-led, not sales-led or founder-dictated)
- Preference for Sydney-based or remote-friendly

**Role Scope Examples (Regardless of Title):**
- Director of Product at Series B reporting to CEO, only product leader
- Senior GPM owning core product or growth at Series B/C with critical business impact  
- VP Product at smaller Series B (functionally Head of Product)
- Head of [Product Area] at Series C with full autonomy over vertical

**Timeline Flexibility:**
- Ideal: Senior Director/VP-equivalent role immediately post-MBA
- Path to Head of Product/VP: Within 12-24 months based on performance
- Not optimizing for title, optimizing for scope and company quality

**Deal Breakers:**
- Title inflation (fancy title, limited scope)
- 3+ layers from CEO (too corporate)
- Sales-led or founder-dictated product culture (no real authority)
- Slow decision-making despite "startup" label
- Companies without AI strategy or adaptability
- Poor culture or toxic leadership

**Compensation Expectations:**
- Minimum: $200-220k base for Director-level role  
- Target: $250-300k total comp for VP-equivalent role
- Willing to optimize for equity and scope over maximizing cash
- Open to below-market base for exceptional equity at right Series B

## Positioning Strategy

### Resume Narrative Arc

**Frame the Story:**
"Product leader who built and scaled consumer audio products to millions of users, now seeking to apply deep product craft and strategic thinking in fast-moving commercial environments."

**Key Proof Points to Emphasize:**
- 14 years in tech (developer → designer → product leader) demonstrates sustained technical credibility
- 20% YOY growth sustained over 3 years (demonstrate impact at scale)
- Award-winning product redesign (external validation of craft)
- Built sales CRM system for CIT Canberra (early commercial systems experience)
- Allianz dealership system: 6-week commercial project designing repair management with call center integration (2015)
- Active in resource allocation, vendor negotiations, and build vs. buy decisions (commercial judgment without formal authority)
- Leading podcast ad tech acquisition evaluation (commercial product strategy)
- Early fintech exposure through Sparro/Indentii project (international payments UX)
- Early AI/personalization work (2016-2018 algorithmic discovery)

**Address the Gaps:**
- Position MBA as deliberate investment in commercial acumen and finance literacy
- Frame CIT CRM work and Allianz dealership system as commercial experience (even if consulting/short-term)
- Mention Sparro/Indentii fintech project to show early interest in commercial tech beyond public sector
- Highlight involvement in resource allocation and vendor negotiations (commercial judgment without formal authority)
- Frame public sector as training ground for stakeholder complexity, now seeking faster pace
- Emphasize 14 years of technical foundation (developer → designer → product leader)

### Interview Talking Points

**Why Leave ABC?**
"I'm proud of building products that serve millions of Australians, but I'm seeking environments where decisions move faster and commercial pressure drives focused innovation. The MBA is my bridge to bring deep product craft into organizations that move at the pace I want to work."

**Why MBA Now?**
"After 8 years building product leadership skills, I recognized I needed formal training in finance and strategy to make the jump to general management. The full-time MBA gives me that foundation while creating a clean break to reposition myself for corporate roles."

**What Do You Bring?**
"I bring proven ability to scale products, build high-performing teams, and navigate complex stakeholder environments. I started as a developer building CRM and sales systems, moved into UX design, and progressed into product leadership. This technical foundation means I can work effectively with engineering, my design background means I obsess over user experience, and my strategic training means I connect product decisions to business outcomes. I've been making resource allocation recommendations and build vs. buy decisions for years - the MBA gives me the formal finance training to do this at an executive level."

**Address the Public Sector Concern Head-On:**
"I understand the perception risk of a decade at ABC. That's precisely why I'm doing the MBA and being deliberate about this transition. I've consistently delivered growth in a complex, stakeholder-heavy environment while being involved in commercial decisions like vendor negotiations, resource allocation, and even leading evaluation of ad tech acquisitions. Now I want to apply that discipline in commercial settings where I have formal P&L ownership and where urgency and focus can compound impact faster."

## Questions to Answer Before Applications

**For Each Opportunity:**

**Scope & Authority:**
1. Walk me through how a typical product decision gets made here - from idea to launch.
2. What decisions can I make autonomously vs. need approval?
3. How often do founders/CEO override product decisions?
4. Who sets product strategy - is it collaborative or top-down?

**Team & Growth:**
5. What does this team look like today vs. 18 months from now if we hit goals?
6. Am I hiring my own team or inheriting one? What authority in hiring decisions?
7. What does success look like in first 90 days vs. first year?
8. How has this role evolved in past year? How might it evolve in next 18 months?

**Pace & Culture:**
9. Give me example of recent decision - how long from discussion to action?
10. What slows down product development here?
11. How often does leadership change priorities?
12. What's the relationship between product and commercial/sales teams?

**Commercial Context:**
13. How does the company use AI? (Assess if meaningful or buzzword)
14. What commercial metrics drive success for this role?
15. How much visibility will I have into unit economics, pricing, monetization?

**Career Path:**
16. What would promotion path look like if I excel?
17. Why is this role open? (Growth or backfill? What happened to predecessor?)
18. How many layers between this role and CEO?

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Vague answers about decision-making authority ("it depends", "we're collaborative")
- Role is one of many at same level with unclear differentiation
- 3+ layers from CEO or limited access to leadership
- Founders/CEO make final product calls despite having product leadership
- Recent layoffs, stalled growth, or high product team turnover
- No clear answer on role evolution or growth path

## Personal Notes

**Motivations & Values:**
- Craves speed and urgency over consensus and hierarchy
- Values outcome-driven thinking over process compliance
- Wants to work at companies that are AI-forward and agile (not necessarily AI companies, but organizations that won't be left behind by lack of AI adaptability)
- Seeks positive, collaborative culture (not toxic "move fast and break things")
- Interested in Head of Product track with potential GM evolution, not rushing toward GM

**Constraints:**
- Owns home in Sydney, prefers to stay but open to relocation
- Currently making $169k, needs meaningful increase to $200k+ minimum
- Will be 37 at MBA graduation, competing with younger candidates but bringing deeper technical credibility

**Unique Selling Points:**
- Rare combination of development experience + design craft + product strategy (full stack product leader)
- 14 years in tech provides depth that most MBA grads lack
- Proven ability to lead through influence in complex orgs (harder than leading with authority)
