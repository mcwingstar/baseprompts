### Environment Mix
Enjoy variety across trips, often combining:

- Beaches (Anna's preference more than Alex's)
- Occasional pure relaxation trips

### Authenticity Level

- Not a strict requirement, but enhances experience
- Comfortable with less developed destinations, though increasingly valuing comfort with age

## Trip Structure

### Duration
- **Standard:** 2-3 weeks
- **Short trips:** 1 week (occasional)

### Planning Style
- Solid overall plan with built-in flexibility
- Multiple days per destination
- A few key activities pre-booked
- Plenty of unstructured time for wandering
- Not overly detailed itineraries, not entirely spontaneous

### Pace
- Deep exploration over breadth
- Downtime is important
- Room to discover unexpected things

### Timing
- **Avoid:** Peak holiday periods (price inflation and crowds)
- **Prefer:** Shoulder seasons when possible

## Activities & Interests

### Core Activities (Both Enjoy)
- **Wandering city streets** (primary activity)
- **Food and drink** (central to travel experience)

### Anna's Additional Preferences
- Shopping
- Beaches (more than Alex)

### Comfortable Splitting Up
- Happy to pursue individual interests separately when preferences diverge

### Less Successful
- Street food can be fun but often causes stomach issues
- Avoid overly meat-centric cuisines

## Accommodation

### Style
- **Standard:** Mid-range hotels
- **Occasional:** Splurge on luxury when it makes sense
- **Priority:** Location over luxury

### Must-Haves
- **Gym** (important)
- Good location in "cool" neighborhoods

### Preferred Neighborhoods
- Hip/arts districts with good cafes and restaurants
- Good public transport access
- **Avoid:** Extremely party-heavy areas
- Look for areas with local character, not purely tourist zones

### Nice-to-Haves
- (Add specifics like breakfast, quiet rooms, balcony if relevant in future)

## Transportation

### Within Destinations
- **Prefer:** Walkable cities (primary)
- **Will rent car:** For scenic drives or when walking isn't practical
- Happy with public transport in cities

### Flights
- Comfortable with connections/stopovers if significantly cheaper than direct
- No specific airport preferences noted

## Food & Dietary Requirements

### Critical Considerations
- **Anna: Pescatarian (fish/seafood okay, no meat/poultry)**
- **Anna: Celiac (strict gluten-free required)**
- **Deal-breaker:** Destinations where Anna's dietary needs can't be accommodated
- Both prefer cuisines not overly reliant on meat

### Preferences
- Love diverse food experiences
- Cooking classes/food tours are a tradition
- Balance of dining experiences (not just street food due to sensitive stomachs)

### Drinks
- **Wine** (top preference, especially light reds, but enjoy most styles)
- Spirits and cocktails
- Beer (Alex)
- Alcohol is an important part of the travel experience

## Budget
- **Approach:** Varies by trip
- **Best Practice:** Ask about budget level for each specific trip recommendation
- Comfortable with mid-range as baseline, flexible up or down

## Art & Culture

### Museums
- Contemporary and modern art (primary interest)
- Unique and exciting is more important than specific movements/periods
- Design museums
- Architecture

### Experiences
- Value understanding local culture and history
- Enjoy guided experiences that explain context
- Prefer independent exploration with some structured learning

## Future Trip Shortlist
- India
- Peru
- Mexico
- Return to Japan (including Okinawa)
- Return to France
- Italy/Sicily
- Greece
- Namibia
- Netherlands
- Belgium

## Deal-Breakers & Red Flags
- Inability to accommodate Anna's dietary requirements (celiac + pescatarian)
- Extreme political instability (use judgment)
- Overwhelming mass tourism with no authentic local culture
- (Ask about specific concerns for individual destinations)

## Travel Traditions
